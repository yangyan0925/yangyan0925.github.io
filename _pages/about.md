Welcome! My name is Yang Yan, and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [the Institute for Chinese Studies at Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/oas/sinologie/index.html). I earned my Ph.D. in Management from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in July 2021 and served as a postdoctoral fellow at the School of Public Policy and Management, Tsinghua University, from 2021 to 2023.

My research interests include comparative politics, political communication, and public policy, with a regional focus on China. I am particularly interested in how political elites in authoritarian countries like China use propaganda to shape their public image and how the Chinese government manipulates political propaganda to garner public support for large-scale digital surveillance project. Additionally, my research covers agenda-setting, the cadre promotion system, and environmental governance.

My work has been published in peer-reviewed journals such as Administration & Society, Journal of Comparative Policy Analysis: Research and Practice, and Journal of Contemporary China.

Methodologically, I employ a variety of techniques, including qualitative text analysis, interviews, NLP (e.g., topic modeling, machine learning), and regression analysis. I am proficient in using SPSS, STATA, R, and Python for data analysis.
